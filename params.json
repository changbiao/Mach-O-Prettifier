It might contain errors or flaws, and it was created for \r\ndemonstration purpose only.*\r\n\r\nApple allows it's binary to run with incorrect load command names in the \r\nheader, which is a great thing to prevent unnecessary error for the end \r\nusers. However, this will break most of the debugging tools currently \r\navailable on OS X. (IDA Pro, Hopper, gdb...etc.) Some malware might use this \r\nan anti-debugging trick. This tool will analyze the load command structures \r\nand try to restore it's original names so it can be debugged.\r\n\r\nThe following architectures are supported by Mach-O Prettifier:\r\n\r\n* i386\r\n* x86_64\r\n* Fat (i386 + x86_64)\r\n\r\n*PowerPC (PPC) is not support by this tool.*\r\n\r\nTo compile:\r\n\r\n`clang mpfr.c -O2 -o mpfr`\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nChangelog\r\n---------\r\n\r\nv0.1:\r\n* Initial release.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\nCopyright (C) 2014  Cai, Zhi-Wei.\r\n\r\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\r\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\r\nthe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\r\n(at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
